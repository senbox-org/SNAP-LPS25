    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how ESA's Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) can be integrated and used in Python environments. The first part will give an introduction to SNAP and the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE). The focus is then put on the usage of SNAP functionality from the Jupyter Hub in the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE), and on how EO data can be downloaded from S3 and processed in SNAP. The SNAP Python APIs will be introduced, and it will be shown how SNAP GPF graphs can be conveniently generated from Python using SNAPISTA. The final part of the notebook deals with the containerization of SNAP together with a Python environment, and the deployment and usage from a Jupyter Lab on a platform outside CDSE.\n",

That notebook **must** be executed with the kernel 'esa-snap' which has recently been pre-installed on CDSE Jupyter Hub. Its package dependencies are given by a requirements.txt file and are listed further below. A SNAP installation and the SNAP/Python components (Snappy/SNAPISTA) are also integrated in the pre-installed kernel.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### ***jpy - a Python-Java Bridge***\n",
    "\n",
    "*jpy* is a bi-directional Java-Python bridge which allows to call Java from Python and Python from Java. This bridge is implemented by the [jpy Project](https://github.com/jpy-consortium/jpy/blob/master/README.md). Current development and maintenance is funded by [Deephaven](https://deephaven.io)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although *jpy* is independent of SNAP, its initial development of *jpy* has been driven by the need to write Python extensions to the BEAM toolbox (the precursor of SNAP) funded by the European Space Agency (ESA).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *jpy* Python module is entirely written in the C programming language. The same resulting shared library is used as a Python *jpy* module and also as native library for the Java library (`jpy.jar`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programs that import the *jpy* module can load Java classes, access Java class fields, and call class constructors and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Java programs with `jpy.jar` on the classpath can import Python modules, access module attributes such as class types and variables, and call any callable objects such as module-level functions, class constructors, as well as static and instance class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code snippets briefly illustrate these technical features.\n",

    "  - the integration of jpy and configuration and initialization of the Java-Python bridge for usage with SNAP.\n",
    "  - extended support for using SNAP functionalities from Python, e.g. running chains of SNAP GPT operators from xml graphs. Formerly hosted as SNAPISTA by [Terradue](https://www.terradue.com/portal/), now bundled into the *esa_snappy* Python package. More details on SNAPISTA are given in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Installation and Configuration:*\n",
    "\n",
    "The *esa_snappy* Python package is available from the Python Package Index (PyPI).  Within the Python environment to use, it can be installed with `pip`:\n",

    "\n",
    "`$ <SNAP_INSTALLATION_DIR>/bin/snappy-conf </path/to/python/executable>`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*Import of Java API classes:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all Java classes from the [SNAP Java API](https://step.esa.int/docs/v12.0/apidoc/engine/) can also be imported in Python by the *jpy* Java-Python bridge, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "product_io = jpy.get_type('org.esa.snap.core.dataio.ProductIO')\n",
    "product = product_io.readProduct('/path/to/product')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the most frequently used Java API classes are already imported by default and do not require an explicit call of get_type(..). A list of those and many more details are given in the documentation [How to use the SNAP API from Python](https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SNAP/pages/19300362/How+to+use+the+SNAP+API+from+Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The SNAPISTA API for graph generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "SNAPISTA is SNAP GPT Python wrapper which has been bundled with the *esa_snappy* package. As most important additional functionality, SNAPISTA allows for a simple and programmatic generation of SNAP GPT graphs and their execution from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "SNAPISTA is a thin but powerful layer with just a small number of classes and concepts. Most importantly, there are the classes `Operator` and `Graph`. Their usage is rather simple and convenient, as briefly illustrated in the following snippet:\n",

    "#### **Implementation of a Python kernel on CDSE Jupyter Hub**\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDSE Jupyter Hub already provides various pre-configured Python kernels via the Launcher. However, users may want to create their own custom kernels for specific purposes. The necessary steps are outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ***Basic steps***\n",
    "From a terminal window on CDSE Jupyter Hub do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new environment named 'snap-cdse'. For the Python version we choose 3.10.14:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `$ conda create -n snap-cdse python==3.10.14`\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Activate the new environment:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `$ conda activate snap-cdse`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install a custom Python environment from a pre-generated requirements.txt file which lists required packages:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "   Instructions on how to build requirements.txt file are given in the documentation of the Python Package Authority (PyPA):\n",
    "   [Requirements File Format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/#requirements-file-format)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install the new kernel in the CDSE environment:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name snap-cdse --display-name \"Python (ESA_SNAP)\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "   The new Python kernel will now be displayed on the Launcher screen in addition to the existing kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ***Snap integration***\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this tutorial, the typical use case would be the integration of a SNAP installation in a custom Python kernel. Selecting such a kernel will allow the user to directly access the Python support in SNAP (Snappy/SNAPISTA) in Jupyter notebooks on CDSE. \n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate a SNAP installation in a custom Python kernel, the following steps are required to be executed after the installation of the Python environment and before the installation of the kernel in the CDSE environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Download SNAP 12 from official download site:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `$ wget https://download.esa.int/step/snap/12.0/installers/esa-snap_all_linux-12.0.0.sh`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `$ chmod u+x ./esa-snap_all_linux-12.0.0.sh` \n",
    "   \n",
    "b) Install SNAP from command line:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `$ ./esa-snap_all_linux-12.0.0.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "   During the installation, you will be asked 'Where should ESA SNAP be installed?' Here you should enter: */opt/conda/envs/snap-cdse/esa-snap*. All other questions should be answered with the default [Enter], except for the last question 'Run SNAP Desktop?' which should be answered with 'No'.  \n",
    "\n",
    "c) Configure/link SNAP Python environment with Python executable of custom kernel:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `$ /opt/conda/envs/snap-cdse/esa-snap/bin/snappy-conf /opt/conda/envs/snap-cdse/bin/python`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ***System-wide kernels***\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation of the new kernel in the CDSE environment as described above is user-specific, as indicated by the option '--user'. As a consequence, it is not permanent and will be lost when the server which has been provided to the CDSE user is shut down (e.g. due to long inactivity).

    "## **Containerized SNAP Deployment (15 minutes)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Container and Docker Fundamentals**\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a tool that allows developers to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux. The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive introduction to Docker and containerization can be found at [Docker Curriculum](https://docker-curriculum.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Create and run a container with Python and SNAP on a Linux host**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a dedicated use case, the following steps describe how to create, deploy and run a Docker container which contains a Python environment together with a SNAP installation with Snappy/SNAPISTA. In priniple, apart from a slightly different set of installed packages, the Python environment in this container is a 'Docker representation' of the Python kernel with SNAP for CDSE which has been described above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The host machine where to run the container can, in principle, be any Linux machine with Docker installed (see below). In ideal case, the machine should provide a desktop environment such as a local Linux desktop computer, or a VM with a GUI which is remotely accessible e.g. via RDP. This would allow to use SNAP/Python in notebooks in a Jupyter Lab environment from a Web browser. This was shown above for CDSE and is also assumed in the steps below. However, within the container the SNAP-Python APIs could also be accessed and used from the command line running a Python prompt or dedicated Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ***Terminology***\n",
    "\n",
    "To create and deploy a *Docker container*, a *Docker image* needs to be built manually or downloaded from a registry such as *Docker Hub*. The image is the blueprint of the application (here: Python, SNAP) and forms the basis of the container. In return, is created from the image by a `docker run` command provided by the Docker installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### ***Installation of the Docker software***\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation of the Docker software is a multi-step procedure and is not described here in detail. A step-by-step guide can again be found at [Docker Curriculum](https://docker-curriculum.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, a Docker installation and creation of images can be done on any machine and not even necessarily on Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### ***Create the Docker image and deploy on a repository***\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker images are created with a `Dockerfile`, which is a simple text file that contains a list of commands that the Docker client calls while creating an image. These commands are similar or even equivalent to Linux commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Dockerfile` for creating the image with Python + SNAP running on Ubuntu Linux is simple and looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
